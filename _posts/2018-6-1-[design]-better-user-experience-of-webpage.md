Here we listed 7 principles for better UX design of webpage.
<ol>
	<li>
		<h4>All are about user experience</h4>
		<p>Both data and content of the webpage should serve the experience. What kind of experience should they present is the true business of the designers.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>What is it about is clear</h4>

		<p>The webpage is not for the reading. Most users just do a quick scan. Thus the presentation has to be intuitive and clear. Visualization charts and visual effects are worthy to be considered.</p>
		<p>Once they are attracted, they would further perform clicking and reading.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Functions for the users are simple and intuitive</h4>
		<p>Highlight the most important button and provide visual guidance to it.</p>
		<p>Enable to hide/show extra functions.</p>
		<p>Consistency is also important. Unified color palette, interaction, and graphics can improve the ease of use.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Universal design v.s. Creativity</h4>
		<p>For things like links, navigation, or layout, our first priority is their usability. And creativity should come next. </p>
		<p>If the rule has to be broken, break at most one rule in a time.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Know more about your user</h4>

		<p>Learn what do your users need, what kind of color, layout, or style they fancy.</p>
		<p>Remember to take their feedbacks into yout design.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Use visual hierarchy</h4>
		<p>The most important elements in the page should be as big and as attractive as possible.</p>
		<p>Visual hierarchy can make the website more clear and more functional.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Control the quality of user experience</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Useful: the content should be useful and meet the needs.</li>
			<li>Available: the content of the website should be easy to find.</li>
			<li>Desirable: Design elements should be emotional and enjoyable.</li>
