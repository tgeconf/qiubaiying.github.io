Here we listed 7 principles for better UX design of webpage.
<ol>
	<li>
		<h4>All is about user experience</h4>
		<p>Both data and content of the webpage should serve the experience. What kind of experience should they present is the true business of the designers.</p>
	</li>
	<li>

		<p>The webpage is not for the reading. Most users just do a quick scan. Thus the presentation has to be intuitive and clear. Visualization charts and visual effects are worthy to be considered.</p>
		<p>Once they are attracted, they would further perform clicking and reading.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Functions for the users are simple and intuitive</h4>
		<p>Highlight the most important button and provide visual guidance to it.</p>
		<p>Enable to hide/show extra functions.</p>
		<p>Consistency is also important. </p>
